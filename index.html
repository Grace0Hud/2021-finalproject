                <p>"The Oh Hellos" is a band - primarily writting music of the folk genre that takes inspiration from things like the writtings of CS Lewis - incorporating Christian ideologies with fantasy. Above is a youtube video with their song "Soldier, Poet, King". Which is about the second coming of Christ and based upon CS Lewis's screwtape letters. The font was chosen because it felt very simple but with character. The color is chosen from the Album art for "Dear Wormwood"</p>

                <p>Ricky Montgomery is one of my favorite artists, sometimes performing with the band "The Honey Sticks" above is a song from his album "Montgomery Ricky" called "Cabo". The font was chosen because it looks similar to the album art of Montgomery Ricky, it also gives a similar... vibe? if that makes sense. The color is also picked from the album art.</p>
