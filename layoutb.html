                <h2> The Crane Wives </h2>
                <p>The Crane Wives are a folk band. In general, they have a very soft sound, which lends itself to pastels as I have chosen. These are also largely from their albumn art. Of which pinks and peaches are heavily involved. The orange is for a fox, which is the title of one of their albums, "Foxlore". They also have what seems to be a very sophisticated feel - which is why I chose the classy cursive writing for their font. </p>

                <h2> The Family Crest </h2>
                <p>The Family Crest sure is something, I wouldn't know how to describe it. Much of the album art is inspired by classical pieces and their music invokes a lot of feeling. The colors are from their albums "The Village" and "Beneath the Brine". The font I chose because it fit their chaotic and bold vibe. </p>

                <h2> The Blasting Company </h2>
                <p>The Blasting Company is the band that wrote and performed the soundtrack for "Over the Garden Wall". Its a soft fall themed show. The colors are taken from the album art. The font was chosen becuase it was so small and neat - which reminds me of the show's gentle nature and concise plot.</p>
