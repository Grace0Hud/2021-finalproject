                <h2> Bears in Trees </h2>
                <p>Bears in Trees is an indie pop band from Britain. I think its slightly funny that I found them on instagram through an extremely targeted ad. The colors are picked from their album "I want to feel chaotic". The disgusting font you see above you honestly fit this odd band. It looked a little mossy to me and they have multiple songs about being swallowed by moss. </p>

                <h2> Shayfer James </h2>
                <p>Shayfer James is a mix of jazz, gothic, ballads, and satire. The colors I chose here are the predominant themes in most of his album art - which is usually made up of darker colors. The font is similar to some of his album art and just gives me the vibes of this strange artist.</p>

                <h2>Florence and the Machine</h2>
                <p>Florence and the Machine is an indie rock band. Headed by lead singer Florence Welch. Welch is a redhead and featured predominantly on most of the album covers - thus the orange on the top left. The others are the predominant color in some of the other albumns. The font I chose was one that gave me a distinctly bold impression. Because Florence and the Machine is bold!</p>
